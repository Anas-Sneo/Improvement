Class Declaration:
public class HelloWorld {

Every Java program starts with a class. The class name must match the file name (HelloWorld.java).
Here, HelloWorld is the class name and public is an access modifier.

main() method:
public static void main(String[] args) {
This is the entry point of every Java application. When you run the program, this method is executed first.

public: anyone can access it

static: you don’t need to create an object to run it

void: it doesn’t return anything

main: the method name

String[] args: command-line arguments (optional input from the user)

STATEMENTS:
System.out.println("Hello, world!");
This line prints output to the console. System.out is a built-in object and println() is a method to print and go to the next line.

braces:
Braces define the scope or block of code — like which statements belong to which class or method.
