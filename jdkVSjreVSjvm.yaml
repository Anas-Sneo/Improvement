JDK:
JDK is a complete software development kit used to develop Java applications. It contains tools like javac (compiler), JRE, debuggers, and documentation tools.
Example: If you're writing and compiling Java code in IntelliJ or Eclipse, you're using the JDK.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment):
JRE provides the environment needed to run Java applications. It includes the JVM + necessary libraries but not the compiler.
Example: End users who only need to run your app would only need the JRE, not the whole JDK.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine):
JVM is the engine that actually runs Java bytecode. It makes Java platform-independent by interpreting the bytecode to machine code.


javac (Java Compiler):
javac is the compiler that converts .java files into .class files (bytecode).
Example: javac HelloWorld.java

Bytecode:
Bytecode is the intermediate code generated by the javac compiler. It’s not readable by humans but is understood by JVM.
Example: It’s stored in .class files and is same across platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux).

JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler):
JIT is part of the JVM. It improves performance by compiling bytecode to native machine code at runtime.
JIT helps speed up code that’s run multiple times (like loops).
